## Running the Demos

The bundled files are already included for you; this allows you to run the demos without needing to pull in any dependencies. Just run the "index.html" file. 

## Modifying the Demos

If you want to modify the demo code, you simply need to change `index.js` in the `src` folder of the demos and refresh the HTML page.
